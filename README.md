FLOWER Trigger Efficiency vs SNR
- Generate trigger efficiency vs SNR curve for flower attenuation scan 

RADIANT Trigger Efficiency vs SNR
- Generate trigger efficiency vs SNR curve for 2/4 multiplicity trigger with the scaling factor (0.54) for attenuation scans with RADIANT data

Cross Correlation vs SNR
- Obtaining the time of max cross-correlations between channels as a function of the SNR
