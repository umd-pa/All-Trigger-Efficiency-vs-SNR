# Flower-Trigger-Efficiency-vs-SNR
Obtain the trigger efficiency vs SNR curve given flower traces

1) Run python3 extract_snr.py to get the second highest SNR across 4 channels for each calibration pulse at each attenuation
  - define path to flower traces (main_path)
  - flower_st11_runAtt.csv maps each run taken for station 11 with corresponding attenuation
2) Run python3 extract_trigger_efficiency.py to obtain the trigger efficiency vs SNR and trigger efficiency vs attenuation curves
  - define path to flower traces (main_path)
  - define path to SNRs for each attenuation (indir)
  - adjust parameters for exponential snr vs attenuation fit in scipy.optimize.curve_fit
